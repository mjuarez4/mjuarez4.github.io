excerpt: 'The RISE program is a four-week, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive intervention developed with the community agency Trellus to support low-income Chicagoans facing interconnected stressors such as unemployment, financial instability, and family conflict. Qualitative findings show that participants especially valued the program’s focus on healthy relationships, small-group discussions, and practical tools like fitness trackers, which helped them strengthen family bonds, improve communication, manage emotions, and cope with daily stressors.'
