excerpt: 'AER for Stronger Communities is a culturally responsive, community-partnered intervention designed to support Afghan evacuees facing stress, trauma, and integration challenges after resettling in the United States. Developed with the refugee-serving agency Trellus, the program combines educational content, an AI-based wellness hub, and fitness trackers to address integration needs, strengthen family relationships, and promote emotional well-being in a culturally meaningful way. Ongoing evaluation through a randomized control trial aims to refine the intervention and establish its effectiveness, with the long-term goal of adapting this approach for diverse refugee communities.'
