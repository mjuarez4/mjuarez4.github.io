Cyberbullying on social networking sites has become increasingly prevalent. Most existing detection models lack consideration of adversarial threads, leaving them vulnerable to manipulative perturbations.  
This paper evaluates the robustness of text-based cyberbullying detection systems against word-level substitutions and character-level attacks, using both classic machine learning techniques and recent large-language-model (LLM) methods.  

Our findings show that adversarial attacks can drastically degrade detection accuracy—up to 88 % for word-level and 44 % for character-level perturbations. In contrast, LLM-based models such as **CyberBERT** demonstrate greater resistance while maintaining strong detection performance.  

These insights advance understanding of adversarial resilience in social computing and contribute to developing more robust, real-world cyberbullying countermeasures.
