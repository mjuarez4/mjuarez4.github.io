I am a 4th year undergraduate student studying computer science and minoring in statistics at Loyola University Chicago.  

I am a member of the [BullyBlocker Researach Lab](https://ysilva.cs.luc.edu/BullyBlocker/) and the [Software Systems Lab](https://ssl.cs.luc.edu/) where I am advised by [Prof. Yasin Silva](https://ysilva.cs.luc.edu/) and [Prof. George Thiruvathukal](https://gkt.sh/). 

I've interned twice at Argonne National Laboratory: (1) I was a visting researcher in the Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) studying social networks and adversarial machine learning and (2) I participated in the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) within the Transportation and Power Systems (TaPS) studying Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications for electric vehicles. 

Some of my research interests include (but are not limited to!)s:
- Social Network Analysis, Computational Social Science
- NLP, LLMs
- Embedded Systems, IoT, V2X, Vehicles
- Smart Cities, Edge Intelligence
- Adversarial ML
- AI for Social Good
- Robotics & Simulation


**I am currently applying to PhD Programs in Computer Science for Fall 2026!**
